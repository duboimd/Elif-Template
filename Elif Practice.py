# if the number is a multiple of five print “Buzz”.

# Q7: Write a program that asks the user to enter a letter, and then prints out "The letter is a vowel" if the letter is a, e, i, o, or u (both upper and lower case), or "The letter is a consonant" if it is not a vowel (Assume that the user will always enter the letters LOWERCASE).
